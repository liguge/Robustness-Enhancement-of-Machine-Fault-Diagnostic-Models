# Robustness-Enhancement-of-Machine-Fault-Diagnostic-Models
## Introduction
This is a repository of our paper "Robustness Enhancement of Machine Fault Diagnostic Models for Railway Applications through Data Augmentation". 
The paper and code have been significantly revised. A preprint version can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344119566_REVISED--Robustness_enhancement_of_machine_fault_diagnostic_models_for_railway_applications_through_data_augmentation

The used Tensorflow version is 1.14.0. Spyder is used for programming and run the scripts.

Three augmentation methods have been implemented: C-DCGAN, SIM-GAN and our MBS-FWFSA.
Exp_mmd.py measures MMD under different condition variations. ExpA, ExpB and ExpC are the experiments to test the ResNet with different preprocessing methods under different condition variations.  ExpA_aug, ExpB_aug and ExpC_aug are the experiments to test the augmentation methods.
